                <p>The game is set in 2027, two years after where women have more sex with robots than with men because humanity have embraced human cybernetic augmentations. With cybernetics and mechanical modifications, anything is possible! Built in grenade launcher? Cloaking system? Phallic modification? Oh sorry I thought we are talking about Cyberpunk. Deus ex IS what Cyberpunk should’ve been with it’s on the fly hacking game-play, gritty world of Night City. I am getting sidetracked here.</p>
                <h3 class="title">STORY</h3>
                <p>In the near future of 2027, right in the middle of late stage capitalism stands Sarif Industries, one of the leading company in cyber augmentations, where receiving a cybernetics implant could mean signing your life to Sarif Industries. Whenever you need something you will always go back where you got them. Sarif Industries technology are not available openly to the public, so the average joe can’t just go into a back alley for bootleg fixes. Need a check up? Then pay the fuck up. </p>
                <p></p>You are ex-SWAT, head security of Sarif Industries Adam Jensen, hired to protect the technology and the best interest of Sarif Industries. Being the leading company in human cybernetics augmentation, Sarif Industries top researcher and your girlfriend Megan Reed is about the present the latest findings that will change the world. Unfortunately, a group of mysterious cybernetically enhanced soldiers invaded Sarif Industries's research lab, kidnapped your girlfriend and shot a bullet into your head after you got your ass handed to a cyborg. Lucky for you, you survived. Unlucky for you, your boss thinks that you are useless unless you got cybernetics enhancements so your boss turned you into a cyborg with no consent to keep you active. Now with cyborg tech and backing of the largest company in America, it is up to Adam Jensen to save his girlfriend (and the company) and investigate the conspiracy that is behind the Sarif attack.</p>
                <h3 class="title">GAMEPLAY</h3>
                <p>Deus Ex: Human Revolution like it's predecessor is an immersive sim that makes sure that you see and feel the consequences of your actions. You are given a lot of options to deal with enemy such as sneaking past them, neutralizing with lethal or non-lethal methods. The game gives you a lot of choices. Too many choices, you will decide your next move, your next takedown and the next dialog choices. You can even evade certain boss fights completely by persuading them to stop. The outcome will be decided based on the choices you have made such as a character will comment on your actions after a mission.</p>
                <p>Stealth in Deus Ex is optional but in reality it’s still pretty much mandatory. Early on you won’t have enough ammunition to take down every opponent on sight. Even if you do, they won’t drop enough ammo for the next fight and you won’t last long if you take a fight without cover. The game enforces methodical gameplay over rushing in guns blazing. The physics object mechanics also play with the stealth mechanics by climbing boxes to reach unreachable areas and vents.</p>
                <p>The meat of the game is the cybernetic augments on your body, you have many options to choose from according to your playstyle. There are many playstyles for you to lean towards such as stealth and lethal. If you just want to commit terrorism, just invest into The Typhoon. What is The Typhoon you may ask, it is a grenade launcher that’s built right into your cyborg body, unleashing explosives at will. The game even showcases the same technology from the start. I won’t spoil the rest of the available upgrades so get experimenting. </p>
                <p>The best part? There are no correct or wrong way to play the game, you are free to choose any upgrade you want, they will all come in handy.
                    The game encourages you to play non-lethal because killing an enemy will give you less experience. In fact, the game discourages lethal encounters by making you piss easy to kill. You die in basically three hits despite your cybernetic augments, taking down enemies only give a pitiful amount of 25 experience points. There are better ways to gain experience by completing objectives or even just exploring the map.</p>

                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The game offers a wide variety of both lethal and non-lethal weapons from stun guns to sniper rifles. Unfortunately, you can disregard 90% of the available weapons. The game gives you the best weapon in the game right from the start which is the puny 9mm pistol. The pistol can do everything you need it to, you don’t even need anything else. It can do long range one shots with the accuracy of a sniper rifle and the flexibility to react to any imminent danger. Truly the best weapon in every scenario.</p>
                
        
                <h3 class="title">CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>In conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a 10/10 must play totally not sponsored by Sarif Industries if you like a Cyberpunk theme stealth that is ACTUALLY a stealth game. The game is also dirt cheap when it’s on sale so you have very little to lose. Piracy is also an option if you want Somalian pirates at your doorstep. What am I saying, fitgirl-repacks.site.</p>
