                <p>Visual novels are hard to get into mainly because it’s just reading, your Gen Z Gen Alpha TikTok infested, goldfish sized brain simply do not have enough capacity to focus on a task for more than 5 seconds. Fear not, as I have something to cure your brain rot disease. The power of words combined with music, voice acting and character designs, you just MIGHT be able to recover your brain from Internet cesspit.</p>
                <p>I recommend games based on price and accessibility and I recommend Higurashi Chapter 1: Onikakushi as your first visual novel to read. The game is free on Steam and easily moddable with 07th expansion to include voice acting, character art and CG. It is highly recommended to install the mod because voice acting makes the characters come alive. The voice acting is expertly done by the Japanese voice actors to make even the most mundane slice of life moments feel active and interesting.</p>
                <h3 class="title">STORY</h3>
                <p>In the near future of 2027, right in the middle of late stage capitalism stands Sarif Industries, one of the leading company in cyber augmentations, where receiving a cybernetics implant could mean signing your life to Sarif Industries. Whenever you need something you will always go back where you got them. Sarif Industries technology are not available openly to the public, so the average joe can’t just go into a back alley for bootleg fixes. Need a check up? Then pay the fuck up. </p>
                <p>The game has plenty of slice of life moments to show the personality of each characters, the slice of life moments aren’t as boring as you think because are filled with action packed shounen-ish writing as they raise the stakes on what is essentially a simple card game. The characters are written very endearing that even if you finish reading the dialogue, you would just let the voice play out it it’s entirety because it adds to the tone and feel of the story. There are four characters introduced in this chapter that are integral to the story which are: the kind hearted girl Rena, the rowdy and playful girl Satoko, the village’s mascot Rika and the daughter of the yakuza boss Mion. Each chapter focuses on different characters to flesh them out and make the world feel alive. The cover of chapter 1 shows Rena which you will be expecting more screentime for Rena.</p>
                <h3 class="title">GAMEPLAY</h3>
                <p>However, do not be fooled by it’s slice of life theme facade. The game is tagged as Horror, Psychological for a reason. The game transitions smoothly from calm, slice of life to psychological horror, as you start to doubt the village and even your friends. The game has horror and violent elements but it is not shown with any imagery depictions, so use your own imagination for that.</p>
                <p>By the end of this chapter, you will immediately want to know more about the story and what will happen in chapter 2. The gripping mystery surrounding the village and the characters will make you want to dive straight into the world of Higurashi and for that I recommend newcomers to read Higurashi chapter 1.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>The best part? There are no correct or wrong way to play the game, you are free to choose any upgrade you want, they will all come in handy.</p>
        
                <h3 class="title">CONCLUSION</h3>
                <p>In conclusion, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a 10/10 must play totally not sponsored by Sarif Industries if you like a Cyberpunk theme stealth that is ACTUALLY a stealth game. The game is also dirt cheap when it’s on sale so you have very little to lose. Piracy is also an option if you want Somalian pirates at your doorstep.</p>
