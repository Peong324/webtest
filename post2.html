                <p>Visual novels are hard to get into mainly because it’s just reading, your Gen Z Gen Alpha TikTok infested, goldfish sized brain simply do not have enough capacity to focus on a task for more than 5 seconds. Fear not, as I have something to cure your brain rot disease. The power of words combined with music, voice acting and character designs, you just MIGHT be able to recover your brain from Internet cesspit.</p>
                <p>I recommend games based on price and accessibility and I recommend Higurashi Chapter 1: Onikakushi as your first visual novel to read. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/310360/Higurashi_When_They_Cry_Hou__Ch1_Onikakushi/" style="font-style: italic;"> free on Steam </a> and <a href="https://07th-mod.com/" style="font-style: italic;">easily moddable</a> with 07th expansion to include voice acting, character art and CG. It is highly recommended to install the mod because voice acting makes the characters come alive. The voice acting is expertly done by the Japanese voice actors to make even the most mundane slice of life moments feel active and interesting.</p>
                <h3 class="title">STORY</h3>
                <p>Higurashi Chapter 1 introduces you to the rural village of Hinamizawa in Japan in the 1980s through the lens of the main character Maebara Keiichi. Maebara Keiichi just moved to Hinamizawa and is trying to get used to the life there. Life is calm and nice, away from the stressful bustling city, as the main character hopes that it will stay like this forever. However, distrusts arises between him and his newfound friends because they do not want to show the ugly side of Hinamizawa. Will he be able to overcome the mystery that surrounds Hinamizawa and trust his friends again? That’s something for you to find out.</p>
                <p>The game has plenty of slice of life moments to show the personality of each characters, the slice of life moments aren’t as boring as you think because are filled with action packed shounen-ish writing as they raise the stakes on what is essentially a simple card game so they don't get the life scarring punishment of crossdressing and getting painted with ink on the face. After all they are just a bunch of children trying to have fun. The characters are written very endearing that even if you finish reading the dialogue, you would just let the voice play out it it’s entirety because it adds to the tone and feel of the story. There are four characters introduced in this chapter that are integral to the story which are: the kind hearted girl Rena, the rowdy and playful girl Satoko, the village’s mascot Rika and the daughter of the yakuza boss Mion. Each chapter focuses on different characters to flesh them out and make the world feel alive. The cover of chapter 1 shows Rena which you will be expecting more screentime for Rena.</p>
                <p>However, do not be fooled by it’s slice of life theme facade. The game is tagged as Horror, Psychological for a reason. The game transitions smoothly from calm, slice of life to psychological horror, as you start to doubt the village and even your friends. The game has horror and violent elements but it is not shown with any imagery depictions, so use your own imagination for that.</p>

                        <span> <i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span> We're friends, right? <span> <i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i> -Rena </span> 
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>By the end of this chapter, you will immediately want to know more about the story and what will happen in chapter 2. The gripping mystery surrounding the village and the characters will make you want to dive straight into the world of Higurashi and for that I recommend newcomers to read Higurashi chapter 1.</p>
