                <p>Let me ask you this: Do you like big, strong men? Do you like Chinese Twinks? Do you dream about siege a castle, being the first ladder climber to claim all the glory in battles? Not me because I’m Asian but if you say yes to all three, then this game is just right for you. Dynasty Warriors is a long time hacknslash fighting game series of more than 20 years starting from the PS1. The settings and story is based on a well known Chinese novel called Romance of Three Kingdoms. I hear what you are asking: Do I need to read the original novel to know what’s going on? The answer is no. That’s because this game IS the introduction to the mostly accurate of Romance of Three Kingdoms.</p>
                <p>For best experience I recommend taking Chinese classes or watch a 6 hour introduction to the Chinese language or you are going to be stuck with horrible pronunciation of the character’s names.</p>
                <h3 class="title">STORY</h3>
                <p>You play as Jung Kook from BTS who recently lost his memory after time traveling back to late Han Dynasty where the emperor’s power is waning due to corruption in the imperial government. The Chinese have this thing called ‘Divine Intervention’ which is basically telling the current emperor to fuck off from his gold plated seat or literally everything else in China will implode. What does population unrest cause? A peasant rebellion or in this case the Yellow Turban Rebellion. With chaos letting loose throughout China, he must fight the peasant rebellion to bring back peace and rizz up all the prominent figures in the Romance of Three Kingdoms at the same time.</p>
                <h3 class="title">GAMEPLAY</h3>
                <p>Your character’s control is fairly simple, light attacks, heavy attacks, ultimate attacks, block and dodge. Controls typical for action games to have. The controls are buttery smooth with tons of progression to unlock. If you are familiar with the series you might be disappointed that you only get one playable character but don’t be put off by that fact. You get to use a total of 10 different weapons all with varying playstyles. You will be fighting in a large battlefield with bases to capture, city to siege. The best part about the battlefield is the sheer amount of troops (cannon fodders) you get to commit mass genocide towards. You rack up the kill counts so fast by the end of the game you might just rival Mao Ze Dong’s KD ratio. The infantry troops aren’t totally useless too even if you cut through them like butter. They can charge at you, shoot arrows, do a little wimpy slash at you, knowing that doing a little scratch is the last thing they will do before death by a thousand slash.</p>
                <p>That’s not all, in some levels your fellow generals will stop advancing and wait for the rest of the army to initiate a charge. This is singlehandedly the coolest shit ever, watching two massive armies clash and fight to the death. This event causes my overgrown man child brain to overload with dopamine better than any gacha games out there, fulfilling my childhood dream I had from playing older Dynasty Warriors games on the PS2. The enemies aren’t just a bunch of cannon fodders too, the generals can do tactics of their own like rallying their troops to defend, ordering a cavalry charge against your army. The battlefield is in a constant of tug of war fighting for momentum measured by morale and courage. The higher the morale is for a side, the bigger the advantage is. You gain morale by completing objectives and defeating enemies such as capturing bases and defeating generals. Courage on the other hand cannot be gained or lost through normal means, only specific events will give your army courage. There is a lot going on in the battlefield so I won’t spoil everything out.</p>

                <h3 class="title">GAYMEPLAY</h3>
                <p>The next main gameplay is the bonding event and that’s where your gay harem fantasy comes true. In times of war, relationships are very utilitarian because you might survive today but tomorrow you could be another number in someone’s KD stat. For this reason, ALL I MEAN EVERY SINGLE GENERAL you get to interact with are absolutely thirsting for the main character. I mean who could blame them, your main character is straight out of a modern Chinese idol boy band. I guess that’s why they call '美人' (beautiful people) instead of '美女' (beautiful woman)  because it includes both genders. With lines such as “Tonight, I wish to etch the features of your face and the sound of your voice into my memory.” and “Tonight, I’m going to take all of your measurements.”, I bet you can’t guess who the hell is saying these lines to you. The bonding scenes are extremely homosexual and yet humorous at the same time, as Sun Tzu have said “There’s nothing wrong with a little gay in your life.”. You should embrace it and have a good laugh.</p>
                <img src="./img/guanyurizz.png">
                <p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is a solid if not the best game within the series that enhanced everything that should be in a Warriors game, even better if you are a homosexual. Go ahead, I know you want to get rizzed up by Lu Bu, hoping that he will dominate you with his halberd in more than just the battlefield.</p>
